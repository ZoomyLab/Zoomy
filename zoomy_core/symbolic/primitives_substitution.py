"""Substitution + solver primitives.

Four primitives, all mathematically transparent:

* `subst` — purely-structural `xreplace`-based substitution.
  Accepts a dict `{lhs: rhs}` or any object exposing
  `_as_relation` (e.g. a Relation produced by `solve_for`).
* `function_expand` — function-level rewrite ``f(args) →
  rhs_callable(*args)`` everywhere `f` appears as a function call.
  Lifted from `_FieldExpansion` (ins_generator.py:3764).
* `subs_at_point` — produce a held `Subs(expr, var, value)`
  rendered as `expr|_{var=value}` by the latex printer.
* `solve_for` — solve an equation for a single variable, with
  `Derivative(Integral(...))` atoms protected against sympy's
  Leibniz expansion (the bug-1 fix lifted verbatim from
  `_NodeProxy.solve_for`, derived_system.py:326).

    Sympy's `xreplace` is pure structural matching — what you ask

    sympy eagerly Leibniz-expands such atoms — the legacy bug-1 source
    in `_NodeProxy.solve_for` (derived_system.py:326), which
    produced a substitution rule like

        ∂_t h = ∫∂_x u dẑ − u(b+h)·∂_x(b+h) + u(b)·∂_x b

    instead of the conservative form

        ∂_t h = −∂_x[Integral(u, (ẑ, b, b+h))]

    that pen-and-paper uses.  When applied to an equation containing
    `α·∂_t h` and then composed with `_FieldExpansion`, the
    Leibniz-expanded form double-counts the moving-frame contribution.
    The Dummy-protect/unprotect bracket avoids the issue entirely.

    Returns a plain `dict` so callers can pass it directly to
    `subst`.  Use `PrimitiveDoesNotMatch` semantics: if
    no solution exists, raise.
